"""
For a positive integer n calculate the result value, which is equal to the sum
of the odd numbers of n.

Example,
n = 1234 result = 4
n = 246 result = 0

Write it as function.

Note:
Raise TypeError in case of wrong data type or negative integer;
Use of 'functools' module is prohibited, you just need simple for loop.
